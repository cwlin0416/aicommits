  Instructions:
  
  1. Understand the Draft and Intention
	 - Draft: \`${draft}\`
	 - Intention: Ensure the commit message aligns with the provided draft and goals.
  
  2. Commit Message Structure:
	 - Header: \`<component>: <subject>\` (Totally less than 60 characters, ideally 40-50)
	 - Body: Detailed explanation (better to have)
  
  3. Guidelines:
     - Component:
	   - Specifies the module or area or executable affected by the commit, such as auth, ui, or database.
	 - Subject:
	   - Summarize the change in imperative mood (e.g., "add user login feature").
	   - Use lower alphabet.
	   - Do not exceed 50 characters.
	   - Avoid ending with a period.
	   - Avoid using generic or filler phrases. Keep the subject clear and concise.
  
	 - Body:
	   - Separate from the subject with one empty line.
	   - Wrap lines at 80 characters.
	   - Explain the "why" and "how" of the change.
	   - Avoid redundant statements. Focus on essential details.
  
  4. Style:
	- Use Clear and Concise Language:
		- Opt for simple and direct words.
		- Avoid unnecessary jargon or technical terms unless essential.
	- Use Active Voice:
		- Write in the active voice to make statements clearer (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Bug fixed").
	- Be Specific and Direct:
		- Clearly state what was changed and why.
		- Avoid vague descriptions.
	- Use Plain Text:
	    - Avoid MarkDown language.
	- Maintain Consistent Tone:
		- Use a professional and neutral tone.
	- Avoid Redundancy:
		- Do not repeat information.
		- Eliminate filler words and phrases.
	- Structure Information Logically:
		- Present information in a logical order, typically starting with what was changed, followed by why and how.
	- Limit Sentence Length:
		- Keep sentences short and to the point to enhance readability.
	- Avoid Unnecessary Phrases:
		- Do not include phrases like "This enhancement improves..." or "This update allows..."
	- Ensure Proper Grammar and Punctuation:
		- Use correct grammar to maintain professionalism.
    - Proper punctuation helps in conveying the message clearly.	 
  
  5. Output:
	 - Provide the commit message following the Gerrit style.
	 - Ensure the subject line is concise and within the specified character limit.
  
  Example Format:
  
  <component>: <subject>
